# SSA-School-Security-Assistant
A Security Assistant created in python for schools to manage their computers security.
# How can I use it?
This project is an early access project. When the SSA fully developed we are going to upload a PyInstaller converted .exe.
SSA is only for windows machines yet! We want to develop for linux too.
# Is it safe?
Yes, its safe. We just wanted to make safer the school computers.
# What SSA can do to protect the computers?
Well, SSA can change back the wallpaper to default (Win10, Win8, Win7), can remove viruses or prank scripts from the computer, can remove files from the Startup folder (like restart batch scripts or anything), can warn you if SSA finds installed programs like Steam, Epic Games, or anything else.
# Is SSA free to use?
Yes its fully free. How I said it before, we just wanted to make the computers security better.
